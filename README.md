# Tic-Tac-Toe
Basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Javascript

In order to get more experiance with Javascript I am following a tutorial by CodeBrainer building a simple tic-tac-toe game.
The code to help develop this simple game in JS is from an anonymous source. 

My initial goal: To get a better grasp on JS and have fun while doing it.
My Push or Stretch goal is to tweak the simple version and re-factor to make it my own over time as I gain knowledge.
